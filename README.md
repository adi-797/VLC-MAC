# VLC MAC

# VLC-MAC-PEERTOPEER
This is the module to demonstrate the working of Visible Light Communication for peer to peer network (having one coordinator and one device).

To execute the files, follow the steps mentioned below :

  1. Open Test_DeviceStart in one Matlab workspace.
  
  2. Open Test_CoordinatorStart in another seperate Matlab workspace.
  
  3. Run Test_DeviceStart.

  4. Run Test_CoordinatorStart (as soon as you perform step 3).

( The results are generated separately in the respective command windows of both the device and the coordinator. )

# VLC-MAC-STAR
This is the module to demonstrate the working of Visible Light Communication for star network (having one coordinator and multiple devices).

To execute the files, follow the steps mentioned below :

  1. Open Test_DeviceStart in multiple Matlab workspaces.
  
  2. Open Test_CoordinatorStart in a seperate Matlab workspace.

  3. Assign a device ID to every device. 
	*  The ID should be any integer between 1 and the total number of devices.
	*  The ID should be unique for every device. i.e., no two devices should have the same ID.

  4. Define the total number of devices in the coordinator workspace.
  
  5. Run Test_DeviceStart in every workspace.

  6. Run Test_CoordinatorStart (as soon as you perform step 5).

( The results are generated separately in the respective command windows of all the devices and the coordinator. )
